Hi! this is a package manager for my Linux Distro in production! 
How to use: put vpm in /bin

Usage: vpm {update|upgrade|install|remove|create}

Happy VPM-ing and if you want you can make programs for VPM 

Version 5.0 is in progress this is sorta a skeleton for now no packages.. yet.
VPM now has Dependency Resolving (yaay)
